Hello, my name is Kiana! I am a recent graduate with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Riverside. I have a passion for embedded systems and robotics. 

Outside of classwork, I love to practice my engineering skills by competing in VexU Robotics Competitions and teaching programming and engineering classes to middle and high schoolers throughout the  year. Scroll down if you're interested in the many other things I do!

![Work-Experience](https://github.com/keeyahnuh/keeyahnuh/blob/main/work-experience.png)  
  
**Mechanical Engineering Instructional Material | University of California, Riverside - Riverside, CA**  
*Start Date: November 2023*   
I am currently collaborating with UCR's Mechanical Engineering Department to develop instructional material for ME students to learn basic circuitry. Using Python, we are developing an interactive practice problem generator that creates circuits and automatically populates each circuit component with a random value. Based on the new values, correct answers for the problems will be stored to respond to the student if their answer is correct.
  
**Facilitator/Teacher | Girls Who Code Club - Solano County, CA**  
*Start Date: September 2021*    
Throughout the school year, I virtually teach middle and high school female students introductory Python. Previously, I have designed a curriculum to teach backend and frontend development with a variety of GUI (Graphical User Interface) projects using the tkinter library. Additionally, I created an embedded systems curriculum for the students to learn fundamental circuitry and programming using C with Arduino UNOs. 
  
**Electrical Engineering Intern | Ocampo-Esta Corporation - Vallejo, CA**  
*July 2022 - August 2022*  
Within this internship, I shadowed many PE's (Professional Engineers) in power systems engineering and substation design for electrical distribution and transmission. I participated in weekly cross-company meetings to discuss any design updates and progress with clients as well as developed curriculum for future electrical engineering interns to understand the basics of power transmission/distribution and the components of a substation.

**Coach/Teacher | C-STEM GIRL/GIRL+ Camp - Solano County, CA**  
*Start Date: June 2019*  
In weekly camps throughout the summer, I taught an introductory coding course of C along with LinkBots to middle and high school female students. I developed a curriculum that integrated computer science and engineering concepts through the usage of LinkBots and Arduino through the usage of breadboards and the Arduino UNO.

**DD-3 (Custom Star Wars Droid)**  
*August 2023 - October 2023*  
I designed a systematic plan of each electrical componentsâ€™ integration and connections, including its power system. After planning, i executed the physical wiring and wiring management of all components.  
*In collaboration with Jess Zarchi*

**UCR VexU Robotics**  
*January 2023 - May 2023*  
My team and I built two robots that competed in VexU competitions for the game "Spin Up." I particularly helped in building and designing a robot that utilized a flywheel to shoot rubber frisbees into a frisbee-golf basket. Throughout competitions, I acted as a Coach of our drivers during matches, guiding the drivers on what they should do while observing the opponents' actions simultaneously. Within this season, our team qualified for the World Championship in our first regional competition by winning the Excellence Award and acheived an 18th-place finish within our division at the VexU World Championship held in Dallas, TX.  

[**Double Microcontroller Rhythm Game**](https://github.com/keeyahnuh/Bop-Bop-Uprising)  
*December 2022*  
I developed a rhythm game that utilized SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication between two microcontrollers. With an Arduino UNO, it was programmed to create a display of the rhythm game "map" on a TFT (thin-film transistor) LCD (liquid crystal display) screen that was synched with a song played through a buzzer. With a FRDM-K64F microcontroller, it was programmed to validate button inputs against the displayed note map, tracking note-hit accuracy (including misses or perfect hits) and a streak count for consecutively accurate hit notes.  
*In collaboration with Vy Vo*
